## About the project
In our project we chose Heart Health dataset because heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and understanding the factors that contribute to it is crucial for prevention. The dataset provides important information like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, which are key indicators of heart health.

By analyzing this data, we hope to identify patterns and risk factors that can help predict heart disease. This could be valuable for healthcare professionals in developing strategies to prevent heart disease and improve patient care. Our goal is to contribute to better heart health by using data to spot trends and offer insights into managing heart disease risk.
